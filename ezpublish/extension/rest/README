About the eZ Publish REST interface technical preview
=====================================================
This release is a sneak peak of what the REST interface will look like.

The goal is to provide access to all the relevant eZ Publish features over a simple HTTP interface, based on open and
well known syntaxes like JSON or XML.

Based on MvcTools, the eZ Components MVC library, it introduces the new front controller that will ultimately be the
only entry point to the CMS features.

Requirements
============
eZ Publish 4.4 or higher
eZ Components 2009.2.1

Installation
============
See the doc/INSTALL file.

Usage introduction
==================
As of the Fuji (4.4) release, content can only be read, not yet written. Content requiring authentication can be
accessed once authenticated with oAuth2.

Authentication
--------------
An oAuth2 interface has been implemented in order to provide authentication on the target eZ Publish with as much
security as possible. It makes authentication using a mobile application very easy.

More details can be found in the extension/oauth/README file.

Fetching content
----------------
All content requests are made using the content resource, using HTTP GET requests. Examples::
  /api/content/object/12
  /api/content/node/128/field/name
  /api/content/node/128/fields

Such requests will return JSON content by default.

More documentation will be added soon, but these basics should get you started.
