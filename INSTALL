Setting up the REST layer
=========================

- The two extension folders need to be placed inside the ez publish extension
  folder

- Activate extensions and regenerate extension autoload data::

    bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php

- Symlink in the rest bootstrap into the root folder::

    ln -s extension/rest/index_rest.php index_rest.php.

- Insert the database schemas for each extension, currently schemas for mysql,
  and postgresql are included. They can be found in the following places:

  - ezpublish/extension/oauth/sql/{mysql,postgresql}

  - ezpublish/extension/rest/sql/{mysql,postgresql}

- Create new rewrite rule in your web server config to intercept the desired
  URLs and forward to this file example::

    RewriteRule ^/api/ /index_rest.php [L]

- An oauth client now needs to be registered in the system, using the
  interface::

  /oauthadmin/list

- The client subsequently needs to be authorized, with a request to the
  authorize controller::

  /oauth/authorize

  The format of said request will be documented in the oauth extension.

- The system is ready to be used.
